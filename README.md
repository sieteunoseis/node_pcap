## Installation

If you want to hack on the source code, you can get it from github.  Clone the repo like this:

    git clone https://github.com/sieteunoseis/pcap_decode.git
    npm install

## Giving Back

If you would like to support my work and the time I put in creating the code, you can click the image below to get me a coffee. I would really appreciate it (but is not required).
